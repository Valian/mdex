# Hello World!

This might be your first blog post!

We can show some nice Elixir code with beautiful code syntax highlighting:
```elixir
defmodule DadJoke do
  def random() do
    Enum.random([
      "Never fight dinosaurs. Youâ€™ll get Jurasskicked",
      "A lion would never play golf. But a tiger wood",
      "What do runners eat? Nothing, cause they fast."
    ])
  end
end
```
